Core data handling

pandas (for data loading, manipulation, and preprocessing)
numpy (numerical operations)
Machine learning and modeling

scikit-learn (models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, preprocessing utilities, and metrics)
xgboost (gradient boosting models; optional but mentioned in the notebook)
Visualization and EDA

seaborn (statistical plots and enhanced visuals)
matplotlib (base plotting)
Model persistence and utilities

joblib (saving and loading the trained model)
Environment and workflow

Python 3.x (a compatible version to match your notebook)
Optional: jupyter or jupyterlab (to run the notebook)
Optional for reproducibility and advanced features

scikit-learn-extra or imbalanced-learn (if you need advanced sampling; not strictly required for the described workflow)
pandas-profiling (optional, for deeper EDA, not required)
lightgbm (alternative gradient boosting; if you experiment with it)
Example minimal installation (pip)

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost seaborn matplotlib joblib jupyter
