# Forecasting Weather Data

A Jupyter notebook workflow that demonstrates a weather forecasting process using historical weather data. The notebook covers data loading, exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a basic deployment pipeline.

## Key Features

- **Data exploration**: Histograms and boxplots for temperature and wind distributions
- **Feature engineering**: Handling precipitation, temperature, wind, and date components (month, day, weekday)
- **Train-test split**: 80/20 split with optional feature scaling
- **Multiple models evaluated**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Model evaluation**: Accuracy and classification reports
- **Model persistence**: Save the best model with `joblib`
- **Inference pipeline**: Simple pipeline for new data
- **Visualization**: Model accuracy comparison bar chart

> Note: The notebook uses a mix of data processing, ML model training, evaluation, and an example inference.

## Contents

- `Forcasting.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook)
  - Data loading: `df`, `X`, `y`
  - Data preprocessing steps: dropping redundant features, encoding targets
  - Train-test split: 80/20
  - Optional scaling: `StandardScaler`
  - Model definitions and training
  - Evaluation outputs: accuracy and classification reports
  - Saving the best model: `best_weather_model.pkl`
  - Inference example with a `new_data` dataframe
  - Visualization: accuracy bar plot
- `best_weather_model.pkl` (generated by the notebook)
- `requirements.txt` (if provided)
- Additional scripts or cells for plotting and evaluation (as in notebook)

## How to Run

### 1) Set up the environment

You can use Conda or your preferred Python environment.

Example installations (adjust as needed):

- Python 3.x
- Packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `xgboost`
  - `seaborn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `joblib`

If a `requirements.txt` exists, install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install packages individually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost seaborn matplotlib joblib
```

### 2) Run the notebook

- Open `Forcasting.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Run all cells in order, or run step-by-step:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Train-test split
  - Optional scaling
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Save the best model (`best_weather_model.pkl`)

### 3) Inference

- Load the saved model with `joblib`
- Prepare `new_data` in the same feature format as `X`
- Predict and inverse-transform the label if needed

## Model Details

### Models Evaluated
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- KNN
- SVM

### Evaluation
- Accuracy for each model on the test set
- Classification reports with precision, recall, and F1-score per class
- Overall accuracy comparison illustrated as a bar chart

### Best Model
- The notebook notes indicate Random Forest achieving around 86% accuracy on the test set.

- Try hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV)
- Experiment with different train-test splits and cross-validation
- Save more robust preprocessing steps (e.g., pipelines with `ColumnTransformer`)
- Implement a lightweight API or function to ingest new data and return predictions

---

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `joblib`
